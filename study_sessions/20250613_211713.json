    "schedule": "Okay, let's craft a comprehensive study plan for Machine Learning and English, tailored to your deadline of June 20, 2025.  This plan balances the two subjects, provides structured learning, and incorporates breaks and reviews for optimal retention.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Your Current Level:**  I'll assume you're starting with a beginner/intermediate level in both Machine Learning and English.  Adjust the pacing based on your actual starting point.\n*   **Time Commitment:** I'll assume you can dedicate roughly 2-4 hours a day to studying, with some flexibility on weekends.  Modify this based on your available time.\n*   **Learning Style:**  This plan is designed to be flexible.  Adapt the resources and methods to your preferred learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc.).\n*   **English Focus:** Since the request specifies both, I am assuming that the English refers to the English language.\n\n**I. Overall Structure & Resources**\n\n*   **Machine Learning Resources:**\n    *   **Online Courses:**\n        *   *Coursera/edX:* Andrew Ng's \"Machine Learning\" (Coursera), \"Machine Learning Specialization\" (Coursera), \"Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization\" (Coursera)\n        *   *fast.ai:*  \"Practical Deep Learning for Coders\" (Highly practical, code-first approach)\n        *   *Udacity:* \"Intro to Machine Learning,\" \"Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree\"\n    *   **Books:**\n        *   \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow\" by Aur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron (Practical, code-focused)\n        *   \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (More theoretical, but a classic)\n        *   \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\" by Christopher Bishop (Comprehensive, Bayesian perspective)\n    *   **Platforms/Tools:**\n        *   Python (Essential)\n        *   Scikit-learn (Fundamental ML library)\n        *   TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning frameworks)\n        *   Pandas (Data manipulation)\n        *   NumPy (Numerical computing)\n        *   Jupyter Notebooks/Google Colab (For coding and experimentation)\n        *   GitHub (For version control and sharing code)\n*   **English Resources:**\n    *   **Grammar & Vocabulary:**\n        *   \"English Grammar in Use\" by Raymond Murphy\n        *   \"Vocabulary in Use\" series\n        *   Online resources like Grammarly, Merriam-Webster, Oxford Learner's Dictionaries\n        *   Flashcard apps (Anki, Quizlet)\n    *   **Reading:**\n        *   Novels, short stories, newspapers (e.g., The New York Times, The Guardian), magazines (e.g., The Economist)\n        *   Websites/blogs on topics of interest\n    *   **Listening:**\n        *   Podcasts (e.g., BBC podcasts, NPR podcasts)\n        *   Audiobooks\n        *   Movies and TV shows (with subtitles initially)\n    *   **Writing:**\n        *   Practice writing essays, articles, summaries, emails, etc.\n        *   Get feedback from native speakers or language tutors.\n    *   **Speaking:**\n        *   Language exchange partners (e.g., HelloTalk, Tandem)\n        *   Online conversation classes\n        *   Record yourself speaking and analyze your pronunciation and fluency.\n*   **General Tools:**\n    *   Calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.)\n    *   Note-taking app (Evernote, OneNote, Notion)\n    *   Pomodoro timer app\n\n**II.
